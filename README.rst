Dynamic benchmark resources
===========================

This code and documentation supports the paper "Benchmark model to
assess community structure in evolving networks" [`arxiv
<http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05808>`_\ ].

For full information on the code, please see ``MANUAL.tex``.  A PDF
version is available under `releases <https://github.com/rkdarst/dynbench/releases>`

Dependencies:

* `networkx <http://networkx.github.io/>`_: standard package for
  network analysis.  Found in most Linux distribution repositories.
  Installation is standard with ``setup.py`` or ``pip``.
* `pcd <https://git.becs.aalto.fi/rkdarst/pcd>`_: My own add-on
  package for network and community analysis.  Not in any
  distribution, but can simply be placed in ``PYTHONPATH``.

For convenience, I have a ``.tar.bz2`` that has the benchmark code,
plus local copies of ``networkx`` and ``pcd`` included.  This is the
``dynbench-fulldist-* from the corresponding `github releases
<https://github.com/rkdarst/dynbench/releases>`_ page.
