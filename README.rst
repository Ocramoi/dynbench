Support code for "A model for temporal networks benchmark generation to assess community structure dynamics"
============================================================================================================

Source code repository is in ``git`` in the `git repository
<https://git.becs.aalto.fi/rkdarst/dynbench>`_.  Full documentation is
found in the `README <README.pdf>`_.

Dependencies:

* `networkx <http://networkx.github.io/>`_: standard package for
  network analysis.  Found in most Linux distribution repositories.
  Installation is standard with ``setup.py`` or ``pip``.
* `pcd <https://git.becs.aalto.fi/rkdarst/pcd>`_: My own add-on
  package for network and community analysis.  Not in any
  distribution, but can simply be placed in ``PYTHONPATH``.

Version history
---------------
* `Latest development
  <https://git.becs.aalto.fi/rkdarst/dynbench/repository/archive.tar.bz2>`_


Packaged distribution
---------------------

For convenience, I have a ``.tar.bz2`` that has the benchmark code,
plus local copies of ``networkx`` and ``pcd`` included.  The version
suffix corresponds to the ``git`` version, for older versions please
get code straight from git.
